## Pattern Description
This pattern defines the logical architecture for service-based communication where:
- Service Providers expose business capabilities through well-defined interfaces
- Service Consumers invoke these capabilities through standardized contracts
- Service Registry enables dynamic discovery and binding

## Key Components
- **Service Provider**: Exposes business functionality
- **Service Consumer**: Invokes exposed services
- **Service Contract**: Defines the interface agreement
- **Service Registry**: Enables service discovery (optional)

## Quality Attributes
- Availability: Services must be discoverable and accessible
- Scalability: Support multiple providers and consumers
- Reliability: Handle failures gracefully
- Performance: Meet latency requirements

## Implementation Options
This pattern can be realized through various technologies:
- RPC-based: See SBB-INT-001 (Dubbo implementation)
- REST-based: See SBB-INT-002 (REST implementation) [if exists]
- Message-based: See SBB-INT-003 (Message Queue implementation) [if exists]
